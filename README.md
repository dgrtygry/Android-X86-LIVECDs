This includes the most recent up to date AOSP builds of Android-X86 for PCs . This is not BlissOS or Android generic builds. This is TRUE Android AOSP X86.



  The source code is just AOSP code compiled for PCs. You can download AOSP code here: https://source.android.com/docs/setup/download/downloading (NOTE: Building Android requires Linux so please ensure you have a Linux environment. 

  I will be making my own Android OS soon.
